# Getting started:
Fork, then clone this repository and run

    npm install

Inside the repository.

Run:

    npm run dev

This will start your react app.
React app will run on **localhost:3000**.

## Start editing the **src/app.jsx** file.

Make it so the text is rendered in an input tag, and whenever we edit that text, it also updates the "items".

Add a Delete Me button in the Card Component, that when clicked will delete that item from the list.
Make it so this updates the "items" state variable, and update that variable so that it re-renders our list of cards, with the proper card updated.
